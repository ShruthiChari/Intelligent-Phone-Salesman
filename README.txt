1. main.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This file refers to the start of the program and it is in this 
file that the various steps of the query generation for a 
particular response from the customer takes place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is used to generate query given a sentence. This means
that we extract the necessary keywords which needs to be used to
query from the provided web-service database. Following is the
main workflow of the program:
	(*) Retrieve contents from the database and store it in a
	    usable data structure that is used across functions as
	    and when needed.

	(*) For a particular sentence, a tuple is generated which
	    stores the words of the sentence and the tags 
	    associated with it.

	(*) Run against all the functions to get the desired output
	
2. backend.py
